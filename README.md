# Challenge \#2 of Vue Guide by @mschwarzmueller

This is my attempt at finishing the second challenge of the Vue series. I've tried my best to write clean code but I've beaten around the bush in a few places. Only using the concepts that leads up to challenge 1. Enjoy and leave your feedbacks in the issues!
